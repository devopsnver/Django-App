# Django Polls Application

This project is a simple Django-based polling application where users can view polls and vote on them. It demonstrates the use of Django with PostgreSQL and Docker for development environments, and deployment to Kubernetes using Terraform for infrastructure management and Amazon ECR for container image storage.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
- Terraform installed for managing infrastructure.
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster.
- AWS CLI installed and configured.
- Amazon ECR access for storing Docker images.
- kubectl configured to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.
- Basic knowledge of Django framework, Docker operations, Terraform, Kubernetes, and AWS services.

## Installation

### Local Development

Follow these steps to get your development environment running:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Django-Polls-App.git
   cd Django-Polls-App
   ```

2. **Build and run the Docker containers**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

   This command will set up the database and start the web server. The `--build` option ensures that the images are rebuilt if you've made any changes.

3. **Access the application**

   Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view the app.

### Building and Pushing the Docker Image to Amazon ECR

1. **Create a repository in ECR**
   ```bash
   aws ecr create-repository --repository-name django-polls-app
   ```

2. **Build your Docker image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t django-polls-app .
   ```

3. **Tag your Docker image for ECR**
   ```bash
   docker tag django-polls-app:latest 123456789012.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/django-polls-app:latest
   ```

4. **Log in to Amazon ECR**
   ```bash
   aws ecr get-login-password --region region | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 123456789012.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com
   ```

5. **Push your Docker image to ECR**
   ```bash
   docker push 123456789012.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/django-polls-app:latest
   ```

### Deployment to Kubernetes using the ECR Image

1. **Set up the infrastructure with Terraform**

   Navigate to the Terraform configuration directory:
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   ```

   Initialize Terraform and apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

   Confirm the changes proposed by Terraform by typing `yes` when prompted.

2. **Deploy the application to Kubernetes**

   Modify the Kubernetes deployment YAML to use the image from ECR, then apply it:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

3. **Verify the deployment**

   Check the status of the deployment:
   ```bash
   kubectl get all -n django-polls
   ```

   Once everything is running, you can access the application via the external IP or DNS configured for the LoadBalancer or Ingress.

## Features

- **Polls Management**: Users can view different polls and submit their votes.
- **Admin Panel**: Administrators can create, modify, and delete polls.
- **User Authentication**: Supports basic user authentication to separate admin and regular user views.
