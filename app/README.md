# DevOps Challenge

This repository contains a simple Django application; a voting application.
It uses PostgreSQL as the database of choice.

## Notes

* docker-compose.yml is present so that you can see how to extrapolate the services towards kubernetes.
* Dockerfile is missing on purpose as part of the challenge. We want to see docker knowledge from the DevOps.
* Take into consideration on the Dockerfile creation the requirements.txt.
